\subsection{Email Sent to Mr. Uri Bram of The Browser}

Hello Mr. Bram,

I am currently working on a machine-learning computer science paper for school. My goal is to compare models in their ability to predict "quality" writing. There is a general scarcity in terms of positive data in this space, and I was wondering if I could utilize your Browser archives. The data will not be published or utilized in any external manner. 

Thanks in advance, \\
